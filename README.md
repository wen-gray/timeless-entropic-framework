## Overview

This repository contains a alternate reformulation of fundamental physics in which temporal structure emerges from geometric correlations across an entropy-field foliation of spacetime. The framework demonstrates that:

- **Time is not fundamental** but emerges from correlations across entropic layers
- **General relativity and quantum mechanics** emerge from a single timeless constraint
- **Thermodynamics** is encoded in the geometry of the foliation itself

The framework is mathematically rigorous, makes testable predictions, and provides a unified substrate for gravity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.

## Key Results

### Correspondence Theorem

In the semiclassical weak-layer regime (ε ≪ 1), the framework reproduces:

1. **Einstein's field equations** for the background geometry
2. **Schrödinger equation** for matter fields (after clock gauge fixing)
3. **Thermodynamic arrow** from monotonicity of relational clocks

### Novel Predictions

- Yukawa-type corrections to Newtonian gravity: |α| < 10⁻² at λ_s ~ 1 mm
- Geometric Berry phases in atom interferometry: Δφ ~ 10⁻⁷ rad
- Curvature-induced decoherence from bundle geometry
- Time-varying gravitational coupling: |Ġ/G| ~ 10⁻¹² yr⁻¹

## Mathematical Structure

### Core Framework

- **Manifold:** 4D Lorentzian (M, g_AB) with entropy field s: M → ℝ
- **Foliation:** Level sets Σ_w = {x ∈ M | s(x) = w}
- **Quantum Structure:** Hilbert bundle {ℋ_w} with geometric connection D_w
- **Dynamics:** Timeless constraint Ĉψ = (D_w - Ĥ_geom)ψ = 0
where I(s) is the Fisher metric of local statistical ensembles. This removes the arbitrariness of scalar-tensor theories.
